    <!-- A connector for sessions that perform bulk transfers of data.
        The network buffers and the outbound queue are larger to accommodate
        higher data volumes at the expense of an increased memory footprint per
        connection. This connector is suitable for accepting fan-out connections
        from secondary servers; back-end clients that perform control functions
        such as updating topics or authenticating sessions (see example fan-out
        configuration for a secondary server in Server.xml); and for replication
        connections between servers in a cluster (see Replication.xml). For
        optimum performance, a control client or secondary server fan-out that
        uses this connector should use an output buffer size equal to the
        connector's input buffer size, and an input buffer size equal to the
        connector's output buffer size. -->
